# Responsive-Flex-1

Web page I've created using images from ...
https://unsplash.com/

Very basic static page. 
Responsive adapting to 780px (@media)
Based purely from flexbox practice.
Really enjoyed this small project.
This is also the second prototype,
Will add more. 
Practiced pushing pages onto "github pages".. Wish I was able to use more.( Try attempting to use netlify)
Pushed entirely off command line. 
Needs more work but I'm happy with this for today.


/* PROBLEMS */

Im happy with how it looks on mobile. I really dislike the photo sizes on in my main content. It feels far to large on a desktop.
(Work on your image sizing.)
